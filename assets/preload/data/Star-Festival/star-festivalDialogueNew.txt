:narrator:default:Our story begins with love and a little bit of stardust~
:narrator:default:It was a beautiful Friday night. 
:narrator:default:The stars shined the brightest this time of year, twinkling and shimmering elegantly in the crisp and chilly night sky.

:narrator:default:This is Boyfriend, a talented rapper and lyrical genius.
:narrator:default:That night, he wanted to go on a date with his super hot girlfriend.
:fade:pro2:
:bg:pro3:
:narrator:default:Coincidentally, her name was Girlfriend.
:narrator:default:He was hoping to finally get some action that night.
:narrator:default:Obviously, he was confident about that, since he decided to stand on top of a moving limo on the way to her place.
:narrator:default:But whether he knew it or not...
:narrator:default:Shit's about to go sideways.

:narrator:default:The two were hanging out as usual.
:narrator:default:Although on this particular night, nothing was really happening.
:narrator:default:Usually by now, a random intruder would force them into a rap battle in some unknown dimension.
:narrator:default:So actually being able to hang out was completely out of the ordinary.

:narrator:gf:What's wrong babe?
:stopsound:
:narrator:bf:Beep bop da bap.
:narrator:default:This roughly translates to "Well this shit sucks."

:narrator:gf:Yeah, same here. I'm bored outta my fuckin' miiiiiiind.

:fade:pro5:
:bg:pro6:
:narrator:default:Boyfriend was no doubt WELL aware of Daddy Dearest's obvious bad intentions.
:narrator:default:Despite that, he knew literally ANYTHING would be better than just sitting here.
:narrator:bf:Bap behp. (Fuck it.)
:narrator:default:So, the two made their way over to the lounge.

:narrator:default:The room was nearly pitch black, with the only source of light coming from a TV in the back.
:narrator:default:Connected to it was a Nintendo Wii with a copy of Super Mario Galaxy.
:narrator:bf:Behp bap bep Wii? 
:narrator:dad:Yup, that's my Wii! You know, with the little stick remote.
:fade:pro7:

:narrator:bf:Skeee ba doh?
:narrator:dad:Yeah! Go on, try it! Swing your little heart out!
:narrator:default:Yeah, subtlety was never Daddy's strong suit.

:narrator:dad:Although...
:narrator:dad:It'll be hard to play once you're trapped inside it.
:narrator:bf:Beh?
:narrator:dad:HAVE FUN, YOU BLUE-HAIRED LITTLE SHIT!
:narrator:default:Can't say I didn't warn 'ya.

:narrator:bf:BAH!?
:narrator:default:Boyfriend watched in horror as his body started to vanish from reality. Daddy Dearest must've used his dark magic to trap him inside the Wii!
:narrator:default:It was the "Hating Simulator" incident all over again...
:fade:pro9:
:bg:pro10:
:narrator:dad:You better get the damn hint this time!
:narrator:default:Boyfriend had completely disappeared.
:narrator:default:Overhearing the commotion, Girlfriend rushed into the room.

:narrator:gf:NO!!! BOYFRIEND!!!

:narrator:default:In a flash, Boyfriend suddenly found himself falling right out of the sky!

:narrator:default:He landed on the ground below with a massive THUD!!!
:narrator:bf:Bap BOP!
:narrator:default:Despite the certainly fatal drop he must've had, Boyfriend noticed he was completely unscathed.
:narrator:default:Just in case you didn't know, there isn't any fall damage in Super Mario Galaxy.
:narrator:default:Then again, Friday Night Funkin' doesn't have fall damage either...
:narrator:default:But shut up, you're missing the point.
:narrator:default:Once he got up, he caught a quick glance of what appeared to be a castle with fireworks going off behind it.
:fade:pro12:
:bg:pro13:
:narrator:default:Boyfriend felt around in his pocket, discovering a letter had been placed inside.
:narrator:default:And it was from....

:narrator:default:Boyfriend entered the lively Star Festival and was immediately surrounded by the sights and sounds of the celebration.

:narrator:default:But before they could share a loving embrace, a familiar portly plumber approached them.
:narrator:mario:Hello! Who are you?
