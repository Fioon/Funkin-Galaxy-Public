### Psych Engine
[Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/PsychEngine) was originally used on the [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107) but later got improved upon and intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. It also aims to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.

### Super Mario Galaxy
Super Mario Galaxy is a 3D platformer developed by Nintendo for the Wii in 2007. The game follows around Mario traversing space and across planets.
